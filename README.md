# Clinic-Reservation
This is a Java project
Project Overview
The Clinic Reservation System is a Java Swing-based GUI application that allows users to book, view, and manage clinic appointments. It provides an easy-to-use interface for patients to schedule appointments with doctors across multiple hospitals and sections.

This system ensures that:
✔ Doctors can only have a maximum of 6 appointments per day.
✔ Appointments are scheduled sequentially from 08:00 AM, with each new appointment having a different time slot.
✔ Users can search for doctors by their diploma ID and view their scheduled appointments.
✔ All doctors, hospitals, and sections are preloaded at startup for easy selection.
